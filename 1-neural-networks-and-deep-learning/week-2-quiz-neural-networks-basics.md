## Week 2 Quiz - Neural Network Basics

1. What does a neuron compute?

    - [ ] A neuron computes an activation function followed by a linear function
      (z = Wx + b)

    - [x] A neuron computes a linear function (z = Wx + b) followed by an
      activation function

    - [ ] A neuron computes a function g that scales the input x linearly (Wx +
      b)

    - [ ] A neuron computes the mean of all features before applying the output
      to an activation function

    Note: The output of a neuron is a = g(Wx + b) where g is the activation
    function (sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, ...).
  
2. Which of these is the "Logistic Loss"?

    - Check
      [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_entropy#Cross-entropy_error_function_and_logistic_regression).
  
    Note: We are using a cross-entropy loss function.

3. Suppose img is a (32,32,3) array, representing a 32x32 image with 3 color
channels red, green and blue. How do you reshape this into a column vector?

    `x = img.reshape((32 * 32 * 3, 1))`
  
4. Consider the two following random arrays "a" and "b":

    ```python3
    a = np.random.randn(2, 3) # a.shape = (2, 3) b = np.random.randn(2, 1) #
    b.shape = (2, 1) c = a + b
    ```

    What will be the shape of "c"?

    b (column vector) is copied 3 times so that it can be summed to each column
    of a. Therefore, `c.shape = (2, 3)`.

5. Consider the two following random arrays "a" and "b":

    ``` a = np.random.randn(4, 3) # a.shape = (4, 3) b = np.random.randn(3, 2) #
    b.shape = (3, 2) c = a * b ```

    What will be the shape of "c"?
  
    "*" operator indicates element-wise multiplication. Element-wise
    multiplication requires same dimension between two matrices. It's going to
    be an error.

6. Suppose you have n_x input features per example. Recall that X=[x^(1),
x^(2)...x^(m)]. What is the dimension of X?

    `(n_x, m)`

7. Recall that `np.dot(a,b)` performs a matrix multiplication on a and b,
whereas `a*b` performs an element-wise multiplication. Consider the two
following random arrays "a" and "b":

    ```python3
    a = np.random.randn(12288, 150) # a.shape = (12288, 150) b =
    np.random.randn(150, 45) # b.shape = (150, 45) c = np.dot(a, b)
    ```
  
    What is the shape of c?
  
    `c.shape = (12288, 45)`, this is a simple matrix multiplication example.
  
8. Consider the following code snippet:

    ``` # a.shape = (3,4) # b.shape = (4,1) for i in range(3): for j in range(4):
    c[i][j] = a[i][j] + b[j]
    ```

    How do you vectorize this?

    `c = a + b.T`

9. Consider the following code:

    ```python3
    a = np.random.randn(3, 3) b = np.random.randn(3, 1) c = a * b
    ```
  
    What will be c?

    This will invoke broadcasting, so b is copied three times to become (3,3), and
    âˆ— is an element-wise product so `c.shape = (3, 3)`.
  
10. Consider the following computation graph.

    What is the output *J*?

    *(a - 1)(b + c)*
